# Track-Mahanagar-Yatayat
This scripts stores the location of all the buses of Mahanagar Yatayat in a csv file.

Mahanagar Yatayat runs around 50 buses in the Ring Road. Using this script we can find all the information about the movement of all of  the buses. My primary focus area is longitude, latitude, altitude of the bus position, time, speed course



My aim is to create a dataset over a long period of time which would store following information

1. Time taken by buses to cover different stops. for eg: how long does it take to go from Kalanki to Koteshowr.
2. Time taken at different part of day. like How long does it take to cover stops at 6 AM, 7AM, ....
3. How holidays affect the time to cover different steps.


Using this dataset we may find answers to:

1. What is the best time to move from one stop to another?
2. Average time to move from one location to another.
